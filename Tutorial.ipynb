    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine executable code, code outputs, and text into one connected file. They run in a web browser, but don't require the internet (unless you're running it on a Jupyter Hub). \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>'kernel'</b> is the thing that executes your code. It is what connects the notebook (as you see it) with the part of your computer, or the DataHub computers, that runs code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Menu Options & Shortcuts\n",
    "To get a quick tour of the Jupyter user-interface, click on the 'Help' menu, then click 'User Interface Tour'. There are also a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. Click on the 'Help' menu, and then 'Keyboard Shortcuts' to see a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have two types of cells, a <b>Markdown</b> (like this one) and <b>Code</b>. Most of the time you won't need to run the Markdown cells, just read through them. However, when we get to a code cell, you need to tell Jupyter to run the lines of code that it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells will be read by the Python interpreter. In other words, the Python kernel will run whatever it recognizes as code within the cell.\n",
